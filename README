iomenu
================================================================================

*iomenu* is an interactive menu inspired from dmenu [1]: it reads lines from
stdin display them to the screen [1], and filter them as the user type.  When
`Enter` is pressed, the selected line is printed to stdout.

This permits to build interactive menu with shell pipes.  As an example, a poor
man's music player could be done this way:

	$ find ~/music -name '*.flac' | iomenu | xargs mplayer

It will print all the FLAC files in `~/music` to iomenu which shows a fulscreen
menu, and the selected file will be printed to xargs mplayer.

iomenu does not use ncurses but ansi escape sequences [2] instead so it does
not have dependencies beyond a C compiler.
