NAME
     iomenu - interactive selection menu

SYNOPSIS
     iomenu [-#] [-l lines] [-p prompt]

DESCRIPTION
     iomenu is an interactive filtering and selection tool for the terminal.

     It reads lines from standard input, and prompt for a selection.  The
     selected line(s) is(are) printed to standard output.

     -l lines          If lines is 0 or if -l is not set, the items are
                       displayed in an horizontal list.  Otherwise, in a
                       vertical list of at most lines lines.

     -p prompt         Set the prompt to display at the beginning of the input
                       to prompt.

     -#                If a line starts with #, iomenu will interprete it as a
                       header, which always matches, and can not be printed.
